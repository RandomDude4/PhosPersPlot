# PhosPersPlot - Phosphor Persistence Plotting
## Simulating Phosphor Persistence of Analog Oscilloscopes

These Matlab (or Octave scripts if you set use_gpu = 0) are proof-of-concept and not in a final stage. 
There are many old pieces of code, commented code blocks, and hacks, left in the files.

I have included one .wav file to test the Main_PPP_v6.m file.
But you need to find your own copy of the Oscillofun song (copyrighted) if you want to render it the same as in the YouTube video below, using Main_PPP_animation_polar_v6.m script. Or any other piece of music or signal for that matter.
